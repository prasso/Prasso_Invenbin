# Inventory Management System

This Inventory Management System is designed to provide efficient tracking and management of inventory for an ERP system. It allows users to manage products, categories, product types, product statuses, bills of material, and their corresponding items.

## Features

- **User List Management**: Create and manage lists of users for various purposes.
- **User List Item Management**: Add, remove, and update items within bills of material.

## Technologies Used

- Laravel: Backend framework for building the application logic and APIs.
- MySQL: Database management system for storing inventory and related data.
- Mermaid: Used for generating diagrams to visualize the schema and relationships.

## Getting Started

A video is available at [https://youtu.be/Q1346GyQjzI](https://youtu.be/Q1346GyQjzI)

### Step 1: Add Repository to Composer

This package is not hosted on Packagist - add the repository to your `composer.json` file. 

Open your project's `composer.json` file and add the location as shown under the `repositories` section:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "packages/faxt/invenbin"
    }
]
```
### Step 2: Require the Package

Run the following command to require the package:

``` bash

composer require faxt/invenbin:dev-main
``` 

If you want to install a specific version, replace dev-main with the desired version.

### Step 3: Publish the Configuration (Optional)

If your package includes configuration files, publish them using the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Faxt\Invenbin\InvenbinServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```
### Step 3.5: Configure Swagger Paths  (Optional)
If you want to use Swagger, You need to add your package's source path to the Swagger configuration. Open config/l5-swagger.php and find the paths section. Add the path to your package's source directory.
Example
```
'paths' => [
        'annotations' => [
            base_path('app'),
            base_path('packages/faxt/invenbin/src'),
        ],
        'docs' => storage_path('api-docs'),
        'views' => base_path('resources/views/vendor/l5-swagger'),
    ],
    ```
Include the @OA\Info() annotation. The @OA\Info() should be added by the main application using the package.

### Register the admin panel

The admin panel needs registering in your app service provider before you can use it.

```php
use Faxt\Invenbin\Support\Facades\InvenbinPanel;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        InvenbinPanel::register();
    }
```
### Step 4: Run Migrations (If Applicable)

run the migrations using the following command:

```bash

php artisan migrate
```
